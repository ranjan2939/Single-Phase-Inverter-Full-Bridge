# Single-Phase-Inverter-Full-Bridge

Step1: Provide input to the carier and control signal.
By default: control signal has been given a sine wave of amplitude 5V and frequency 50Hz with an offset of 5V.
            carier signal has been given a triangluar wave of amplitude of 10V.

Step2: Provide input(V1) to inverter circuit.
By default: 300V is given to the input.

Step3: Run the program for desired amount of time.
